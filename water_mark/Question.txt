Create a custom module in Drupal 8 that will add Image or text watermark to all the images on the website.
Admin user should have access to select whether an Image watermark or Text watermark has to be added.
If the image watermark is selected, the admin user should have access to select the image that should be added as a watermark.
If text watermark is selected, the admin user should have access to add his custom text that should be added as a watermark.
The added watermark should be added as an overlay to all the images on the website.

Also, an authenticated user will have access to his configuration page where he can select an image or text watermark.
If the authenticated user adds a watermark, then his watermark will be added for all the images on the website when he is accessing the website.
This selection will not affect other authenticated or anonymous users on the website.


Eg:- If Admin adds image overlay with image xyz.jpg. All the images on the website will have xyz.jpg as a watermark.
If user X, adds image overlay abc.jpg. All the images on the website will have abc.jpg as a watermark (only for user X).
If user Y, access the website. He/She will see xyz.jpg as the watermark (admins selection as default).
If user Z, add text overlay as "TEST". All the images on the website will have TEST as a watermark (only for user Z).
